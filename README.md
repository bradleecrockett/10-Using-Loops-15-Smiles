# 15 Smiles

* Create a while loop inside the draw function.  
* The loop should draw 15 smiley faces at different locations by calling the `drawSmile` function once inside the loop.
* Create comments that identify the parts of the loop. You must use at least the following terms:
    *  repeat condition
    *  increment (or decrement)
    *  variable
    *  initialize
    *  declare

Finally, write a comment that describes which line(s) of code prevents an infinite loop.
